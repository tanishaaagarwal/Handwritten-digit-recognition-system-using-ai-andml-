# Handwritten-digit-recognition-system-using-ai-andml-
Developed a machine learning model to accurately identify handwritten digits (0-9) from image inputs. Utilized convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract features and classify digits, improving recognition accuracy through data augmentation and preprocessing techniques.
mplemented the project using Python libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV, demonstrating practical applications of AI in image processing and pattern recognition.
